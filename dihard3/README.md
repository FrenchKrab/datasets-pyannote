# DIHARD-3 for Pyannote

DIHARD-3 is a paid dataset available at https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2022S14.

We cannot provide any download. However, we still provide a `setup.sh` (it had limited testing, nothing bad should happen, but just in case, please back up your data). You can modify the links in the first lines of the setup script to the data location, and hope that everything works.


Out-of-the-box protocol for pyannote.audio training is `DIHARD.SpeakerDiarization.Custom1`.
